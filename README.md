**Telegraph** is a Laravel package for fluently interacting with Telegram Bots made by [def:studio] and edited by me.

Modifications:
a) Added language_code column to store the userâ€™s language preferences. See Handlers/WebhookHandler.php.
b) This can be disabled in the config.
c) Added class TeleGraphAndGram, which extends WebhookHandler with some useful commands. To publish, see the command below.

```php
Telegraph::message('hello world')
    ->keyboard(Keyboard::make()->buttons([
            Button::make('Delete')->action('delete')->param('id', '42'),
            Button::make('open')->url('https://test.it'),
    ]))->send();
```

## Installation

You can install the package via composer. To do so, copy this to `composer.json`:

```json
"require": {
    ...other repos,
    "vitalyevrica/telegraph": "dev-main"
},
"require-dev": {
    ...other repos,
    "vitalyevrica/telegraph": "dev-main"
},
"repositories": [
    {
        "type": "vcs",
        "url": "https://github.com/VitalyEvrica/telegraph"
    }
],

```

Publish and launch required migrations:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag="telegraph-migrations"
```

```bash
php artisan migrate
```

Optionally, you can publish the config, translation *and controller* with some commands with:
```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag="telegraph-config"
```
```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag="telegraph-translations"
```
```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag="telegraph-add-default-controller-to-http-folder"
```

## Usage & Documentation

After a new bot is created and added to a chat/group/channel (as described [in our documentation](https://docs.defstudio.it/telegraph/v1/quickstart/new-bot)),
the `Telegraph` facade can be used to easily send messages and interact with it:

```php
Telegraph::message('this is great')->send();
```

An extensive documentation is available at

https://docs.defstudio.it/telegraph

## Testing

```bash
